# ðŸš— Automobile Inventory System

## Overview

This project is a Java-based automobile inventory system designed to manage vehicle data using an object-oriented approach. The core class, `Automobile`, represents individual vehicles and includes functionality to add, update, remove, and list vehicle details. Each vehicle is assigned a unique ID for easy reference and manipulation. The class is structured with maintainability and modular design in mind and is ready for integration into a full inventory management system.

## ðŸ”§ Features and Functionality

### âœ… Core Class Structure
- **Encapsulated Instance Variables** (`private`): make, model, color, year, mileage, id
- **Static Variable**: auto-incrementing `id` using a shared `nextID` counter

### âœ… Constructors
- **Default Constructor** â€“ Initializes a vehicle with blank/default values
- **Parameterized Constructor** â€“ Creates a vehicle using provided values

### âœ… Methods Implemented
- `addNewVehicle(...)` â€“ Adds new data to the vehicle
- `updateVehicle(...)` â€“ Replaces vehicle attributes with new values
- `removeVehicle(id)` â€“ Clears vehicle data only if the ID matches
- `listVehicleInfo()` â€“ Returns a string array of vehicle details
- `getID()` and other getters â€“ Return individual values for external reference

Each method includes **try/catch error handling** and returns a message string to indicate success or failure.

## ðŸ“š Skills and Java Concepts Explored

| Concept                      | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Object-Oriented Design**  | Used classes, instance variables, and methods to encapsulate vehicle logic. |
| **Constructors**            | Practiced both default and parameterized constructor creation.              |
| **Encapsulation**           | Protected internal variables with `private` and exposed them via getters.   |
| **Method Design**           | Built custom methods for adding, updating, removing, and displaying data.   |
| **Error Handling**          | Used `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle runtime errors.                |
| **Static Variables**        | Used a shared `nextID` to uniquely identify vehicles.                       |
| **Code Reusability**        | Designed the class for future integration into a full inventory system.     |
| **User-Centered Design**    | Built around user prompts, unique IDs, and method responses for clarity.    |
